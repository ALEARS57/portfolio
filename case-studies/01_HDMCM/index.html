        <p>
            A user-friendly desktop application that enables students to sell and buy second-hand items easily within
            their campus environment. It was our first large-scale JavaFX project, where we combined the basics we

            workflow. </p>

                        Create a clean, intuitive marketplace UI that enables users to easily browse, list, and purchase

                    I aimed to go beyond functionality and explore how technical projects can be designed with the user
                    in mind. My personal goal was to make the UI clear and accessible—even to people who aren't
                    tech-savvy—and use this opportunity to improve my frontend logic and visual consistency.

                To better understand how users interact with peer-to-peer marketplaces, we analyzed apps like Vinted and
                local listing platforms. We conducted informal interviews with students to understand pain points when
                buying or selling second-hand items and sketched out basic assumptions based on their needs.

                        execution. I started noticing how small layout details could change how people use a feature,
                        and learned to prototype, test, and iterate ideas in code. It also improved how I communicate
                        design intent within our team.

            <p class="section-description">
                We developed the app in Java using JavaFX for the GUI and CSS for styling. Core functionality included
                user authentication, item listing, and dynamic content rendering. The development process was shaped by
                frequent iteration, bug fixing, and learning how to break features into modular components for testing
                and deployment.

            <!-- User Flow Journey -->
            <div class="develop-block">
                <h3>User Flow Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    We designed the user journey to be intuitive and efficient, ensuring that each step felt familiar
                    and easy to navigate. A user could quickly register or log in with their email credentials, then
                    immediately access a personalized feed showing the most recent listings. From there, they could
                    browse categories or use the search bar to find specific items. Selecting a product opened a
                    detailed view with images, a description, and seller contact options. Communication between buyer
                    and seller was handled through a built-in messaging system that kept everything within the app.
                    Listing an item was equally seamless, requiring only a few fields and an image upload before it was
                    ready to go live.

                <h3>Site Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    The application was built using a modular architecture inspired by the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
                    design pattern. This allowed for a clear separation between data management, visual layout, and
                    interaction logic. Each section of the app—such as login, item listing, browsing, and messaging—was
                    structured as an individual scene, making it easier to develop and test independently. The views
                    were constructed using JavaFX, styled through custom CSS to maintain consistency, while the
                    controllers handled all navigation and user input. This structure kept our development process
                    organized and scalable as the project evolved.

                <h3>Early Concepts</h3>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the project, we started with simple paper sketches to outline the structure and
                    layout of our marketplace. These low-fidelity wireframes helped us get quick feedback and iterate on
                    the layout before committing to development. We focused on clarity—designing with minimal
                    distractions and prioritizing functionality. Our earliest ideas included a card-style layout for
                    listings, clear filtering options, and a simple upload flow. These concepts helped us define what
                    the app should do at its core, and what kind of visual hierarchy would support a seamless
                    experience.

            <p class="section-description">
                The first working prototype was developed directly in JavaFX and featured all core functionalities,
                including account registration, login, item browsing, listing creation, and internal messaging. We kept
                the visuals intentionally basic at this stage so we could focus on testing logic, navigation, and error
                handling. Multiple iterations were required, especially around input validation and scene transitions,
                but each round brought us closer to a stable, usable app. Once the foundational features were tested
                thoroughly, we moved on to implementing our design system for a more polished final appearance.

            <p class="section-description">
                Since we were working within the limitations of JavaFX, styling had to be approached with care. Using
                CSS, we created a visual identity that was both calm and functional. The design leaned on soft edges,
                muted greens and greys, and a generous use of whitespace to evoke a sense of trust and familiarity. Font
                choices emphasized readability, and contrast was carefully balanced to ensure accessibility across
                different devices. Every visual element was kept consistent across the application, which not only made
                it feel more professional but also easier to use.

                We completed and delivered the project as a functional desktop application, fully documented and
                submitted as part of our university coursework. The submission included not only the application itself
                but also the full development process, from planning and wireframing to implementation and testing.
                Looking back, this project stands as our first major software product—a tangible result of everything we
                had learned up to that point.
